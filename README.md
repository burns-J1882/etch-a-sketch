Goal is to make a grid that acts as an etch a sketch where a user can change  colors or change the grid size using javascript

The grid is now 1x1 squares and The hoer works! when applying the same thing to so many elements it's important to remember they are array-like so iterating over it with a for of loop to apply the function to every item in that array-like object is key.

Grid is now re-sizeable, the hover still works and I am turning the functions into named functions. Next up is trigger the hover to work after clicking in the div, and then styling the page!
