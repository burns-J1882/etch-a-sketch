Goal is to make a grid that acts as an etch a sketch where a user can change  colors or change the grid size using javascript

The grid is now 1x1 squares and The hoer works! when applying the same thing to so many elements it's important to remember they are array-like so iterating over it with a for of loop to apply the function to every item in that array-like object is key.

Grid is now re-sizeable, the hover still works and I am turning the functions into named functions. Next up is trigger the hover to work after clicking in the div, and then styling the page!

The hover now triggers after a click and I added this monochrome brown styling to the page. Need to add a limit to the size the grid can be, 100 should be good enough. Found an issue where if I cancel after a button click the containers clickTrigger doesn't work so I need to figure that out.

Added a limit to the box size. The clickTrigger now seems to work after a cancel so cool. I'm done for now but I can add eraser, and color change abilities at a later time. Might be worth making the box a slider or a box as opposed to a prompt and the alerts just a message.
